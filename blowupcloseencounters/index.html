        I really love this movie, Blow Up by Antonioni. I had never before seen so perfectly expressed the relationship between objectification and photography.

      </p><p>

        I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the inherently objectifying and patriarchal element to the medium of film itself.  This isn’t to say I don’t love film (after all, my best reference to discuss the problems inherent in film is a brilliant film), but it’s more that I think it’s interesting to think about how an idea, or an ephemeral, unnameable thing, when wrangled into the artistic method of film, becomes subjected to patriarchy, becomes somehow perverted. I guess in street photography and documentary there is a lot more room for the people in front of the lens to be subjects rather than objects, rather than props for someone else’s vision. I also think it’s interesting, and disturbing, how beautiful film actors must often be, and the things they must subject themselves to in order to stay sufficiently beautiful.

      </p><p>


        Here is where the objectification comes in: the camera, the eye, is watching, and the actor is performing for that eye, over and over, take after take, while the director zooms in on tears, squeezes as much human pulp as she can out of her subjects. It’s obvious that film is voyeuristic, but it’s the passivity of the voyeurism that makes film feel so perverted. The unblinking, unmoved eye of the camera captures, greedily laps up, take after take of joy and pain and sorrow and surprise and fear and sexuality from the very real very human actor. And then the audience watches, whenever they want, and however they want, while doing whatever they want, the captured image of that human actor, from behind a one-way mirror.

      </p><p>

        People are more likely to laugh out loud at a comedian who is right in front of them. They’re also more likely to yell stupid insults at a comedian who's right in front of them, but that’s for the same reason that they’re more likely to laugh. It’s forced engagement, it’s non-passive, there is no one-way mirror, no glass between viewer and performer, you’re right in front of one another. A live show asks for something from the audience in return for the performance given by the actors, comedians, magicians, etc. And the audience feels the tension when they don’t perform their part: when they don’t laugh, when they fall asleep, when they leave to go to the bathroom. Can you imagine the feeling at the end of a play, if the actors took a bow and not a single person clapped? Nowadays people feel pressured to give a standing ovation after every single performance. It’s a two-way relationship, it’s very clear in theater that the performers are humans just like you, whereas in film their humanity can become an idea. As Sarah Ruhl puts it in her essay "Eating What We See", "Because there are real people acting [on stage], we cannot own their image; we cannot have them. Perhaps that is why movie stars come back to the stage: to be, without being had." In this way, I’d say, the camera is the problem.  

      </p><p>


        I’ve also been comparing the role of a director of theatre and a director of film, and wondering if one is an inherently patriarchal role, and the other is inherently matriarchal. In theater, the director nurtures something until it is ready to go off on it’s own, and then all the director can do is watch from backstage, or the audience, as the play does whatever it wants to do, hoping she helped it to be good. A film director directs and controls the real-time performances of her actors, until it is exactly the way she believes it to best, and moves on, using her actors to create her own vision of a world. There is never a time when the film director nurtures and then steps back, when they are not directly in control of both what is being done and how. This is not a gripe about the intentions of film directors, but rather, it’s about the characteristics that the medium of film carries with it and  imposes on anyone, man, woman, or beyond, who wants to direct or act in a film. It’s a different process that creates a different product, regardless of how caring, fair, and unpatriarchal the director might be as a person.
        I was thinking about all of this, and ready to stop there: theater is less perverted than film, the end. But, I went downstairs and my mom was watching Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which I watched as a little kid but don’t remember well. It was near the beginning of the movie, the press conference scene after the photo of the UFO has been released. I was immediately blown away by the directing. I love Steven Spielberg, Jaws is one of my favorite movies, and just watching that scene made me realize something else about film, about directing.

      </p><p>

        It’s always rubbed me the wrong way when I watch Hollywood actors and directors get shiny-eyed and humble and talk about “storytelling”. “At the end of the day, we’re just trying to tell a story,” they always say, and it never really feels true to me. On the one hand, yes, sure, tell a story, especially an important one. Stories can change the world. But is every film, the entire medium, the entire industry, really based around a mutual love of storytelling? It might be, and I might just be less connected to it. But, while watching Close Encounters, I realized that I think the basis for good directing is not a love of “storytelling”, but a deep love of people. Of seeing people, of looking closely and deeply at people and seeing them, and celebrating seeing them, looking upon every person with attention, reaching toward a better understanding of humanity by watching it actively. A director focused on her love of storytelling can easily fall into the trap of using her actors as props, of flattening their humanity, but a director with an obsessive interest in seeing, loving, and understanding humanity has the power to turn the camera’s passive eye into an active one.
